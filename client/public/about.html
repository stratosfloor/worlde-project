    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project is an assignment in a course in Fullstack development at Lernia, 
      program Systemdeveloper in Java and Javascript. The project is to a build a fullstack game inspired by Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). 
      The game frontend is built in React. Backend is built in Node js with Express. The highscore i stored in a MongoDB-database, 
      using Moongoose to connect from backend. The highscores are then generated server-side using Ejs.
